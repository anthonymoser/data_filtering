# data_filtering
A code exercise in filtering CSV data. Each Python file exports two CSVs containing filtered data from the original CSV; one of Republicans without Twitter or YouTube accounts, the second of Democrats under 45. 

legislators.py requires Pandas to run; legislators_2.py does not have any package dependencies.
